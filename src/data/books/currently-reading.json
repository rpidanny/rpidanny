This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole--a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.<br /><br />Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.<br /><br />When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:<br /><br /><br />Syntax<br />Objects<br />Functions<br />Inheritance<br />Arrays<br />Regular expressions<br />Methods<br />Style<br />Beautiful features<br />The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to <em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.<br /><br />With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1290380","name":"Douglas Crockford","role":{},"image_url":{"nophoto":"true","$t":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"},"small_image_url":{"nophoto":"true","$t":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1290380.Douglas_Crockford","average_rating":"4.15","ratings_count":"8532","text_reviews_count":"550"}},"published":"2008","work":{"id":"3028639","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Z1HuMZSt3rIihybug4m1dw"}},{"id":{"type":"integer","$t":"25135194"},"isbn":"1783961414","isbn13":"9781783961412","text_reviews_count":{"type":"integer","$t":"938"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.fbPazR2wjzs4dAy159d5zw","title":"Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics","title_without_series":"Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1432827094m/25135194.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1432827094s/25135194.jpg","large_image_url":{},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25135194-prisoners-of-geography","num_pages":"256","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":{},"publisher":"Elliott & Thompson","publication_day":"9","publication_year":"2015","publication_month":"7","average_rating":"4.24","ratings_count":"19663","description":"All leaders are constrained by geography. Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas and concrete. Yes, to follow world events you need to understand people, ideas and movements – but if you don’t know geography, you’ll never have the full picture.<br /><br />If you’ve ever wondered why Putin is so obsessed with Crimea, why the USA was destined to become a global superpower, or why China’s power base continues to expand ever outwards, the answers are all here.<br /><br />In ten chapters (covering Russia; China; the USA; Latin America; the Middle East; Africa; India and Pakistan; Europe; Japan and Korea; and the Arctic), using maps, essays and occasionally the personal experiences of the widely travelled author, Prisoners of Geography looks at the past, present and future to offer an essential insight into one of the major factors that determines world history.<br />","authors":{"author":{"id":"713466","name":"Tim Marshall","role":{},"image_url":{"nophoto":"false","$t":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1489696759p5/713466.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"nophoto":"false","$t":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1489696759p2/713466.jpg"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/713466.Tim_Marshall","average_rating":"4.20","ratings_count":"21525","text_reviews_count":"2143"}},"published":"2015","work":{"id":"44832697","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.yCgLqDJh7OI4QSI68DhAjQ"}}]
